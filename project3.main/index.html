       <h2>Love nature</h2>
       <p>Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.</p>

        <h2>Care Nature</h2>
        <p>It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into most of the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different spheres on Earth. Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the need to meet demands is increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil and noise pollution as a result of the universal dependence on technology.</p>

        <h2>Nature is Everything </h2>
        <P>While it is necessary to keep up with industrialization, it is an urgent need now to restore stability in nature. People are trying to curb the level of pollution and stop the exhaustion of natural resources. However, more awareness and implementation is a must at the individual and community levels. We must always remember it is us who depend on nature for survival and not the other way round.</P>

        <h2>Love of Nature</h2>
        <p>Every member of the living world obtains its life support from nature. Nature guides the cycling of air, water and life between the different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in nature not only provide for our basic requirements of survival but also fuel the raw materials to support factories and industries on which the modern world primarily runs.</p>

         <h2>Nature made by God</h2>
         <p>Since the population is increasing at an exponential rate largely in India and many parts of the world, the “use” of resources has now turned to depletion. Adding to this, are the excessive levels of atmospheric and environmental pollution. Industrial wastes, unchecked use of vehicles, illegal cutting of trees, poaching of animals, nuclear power plants and many more are contributing to the disruption of the natural systems and global warming.</p>

         <h2>Grow Plants and Care</h2>
         <p>History is a witness to the extinction of organisms as large as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as minute as ants. In addition to other factors, it is inevitable to remember that nature can take up both constructive and destructive roles. Through natural calamities, pandemics and natural crisis situations, nature has well explained the need for us to conserve nature so as to continue life on Earth for our future generations.</p>
