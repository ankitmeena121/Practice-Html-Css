             <h2> " Iron Man Of India "</h2>
             <p><b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b> was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in an atmosphere of traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high school at Petlad but was mainly self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at 22, and passed the district pleaderâ€™s examination, which enabled him to practice law. In 1900 he set up an independent office of district pleader in Godhra, and two years later he moved to Borsad. <br>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's contributions to India's freedom struggle, his role in uniting the nation, and his commitment to justice and equality have left an indelible mark on India's history. He remains a symbol of courage, leadership, and national pride.</p>
